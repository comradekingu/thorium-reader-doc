Advice
{{< columns >}}
If you select a portion of text and then activate the `Bookmark` button, 
the bookmark created will have the selected line as its title.

If you have bookmarked a line without selecting a portion of text, try copying 
the line you are on in the clipboard.
Then go to the navigation options with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>,
then scroll down to the Bookmark section, where they are listed.
Press the b key to move to the edit button to 
rename the bookmark. Paste the line from the clipboard and press
<kbd>Enter</kbd>. This renames the bookmark with the line of text that you have
copied. When you have several bookmarks, this renaming of the bookmarks allows 
you to use them easily.

{{< details "Using bookmarks with NVDA">}}

Remember that Windows screen readers use a virtual buffer
for reading. To place a bookmark where you are currently reading
press the key combination <kbd>NVDA + Enter</kbd>, and NVDA will say *"activate "*. This
synchronizes the virtual buffer with the current real location, then use
<kbd>Ctrl + B</kbd> to place a bookmark.

Use <kbd>NVDA</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> for Thorium to deduce the object
on which the cursor is located. Then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>.
A sound notification will inform you of the number of bookmarks in the current publication.
